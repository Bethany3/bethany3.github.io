This is the first chapter of how I designed this site. I will explain my choice of the site engine, share some concepts that ultimately shaped this site and elaborate on the functionalites of this site. This project has taken nearly a week to develop and fine tune.

First let me give a visual snapshot of the blogging process.

**Speed** is the word this site is built around. From the initial sketches to the development phases to the final production, speed has been the point of focus. 

## August 2014 - The Design

I was feeling quite apathetic towards using [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) and wanted to integrate a status announce system inside my blog. I had a few concepts of how to implement this feature.
