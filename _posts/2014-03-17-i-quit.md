I will have my last puff of smoke tonight. I had been meaning to quit this -- well for lack of a better term here-- disgusting habit for a while now, but it seemed that I wasn't smoking the cigarettes anymore, rather the cigarettes were smoking me. Its high time to quit, and I want to quit so badly. While it doesn't mean that I will not give in to the urge of nicotine in near future, it simply means I am retiring this non-stop hourly habit.
