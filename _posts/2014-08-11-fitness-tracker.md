I started going to a gym. I do not workout much, I never have worked out much as a young adult. Now that I have started I thought, it will be a good idea to keep track of my workout, and what better platform can I get other than publishing my day-to-day performance on my own blog.

So I created this excel sheet recording my daily workout routine. This graph is generated using a vb script and is updated regularly.

The chart may change its appearance in the coming days depending on my workout plan.
