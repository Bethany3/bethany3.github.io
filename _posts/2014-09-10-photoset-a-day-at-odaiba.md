Odaiba (お台場) is a large artificial island in Tokyo Bay, Japan, across the Rainbow Bridge from central Tokyo. Since the 1990s, it has expanded dramatically as a major commercial, residential and leisure area. Odaiba, along with Minato Mirai 21 in Yokohama, are two of the only places in the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan area where the seashore is accessible, and not blocked by industry and harbor areas.

On a fine morning, ammu and I headed for Odaiba. It was a commute of around 2 hours by trains with multiple stops (Ohanajaya --> Ueno --> Shimbashi --> Odaiba). The day started out a little hectic as Tokyo's metro service is painstakingly reliable(:P). After we reached the Shimbashi Station, it got a little relaxed and we took a few photos there.
