I use to like the idea -back in 2003- not anymore. It feels suffocating, at the same time the idea of being connected to everything and everyone I know is so alluring, so captivating, so addictive. In the olden days when I was growing up, the days of the dial-up internet, I could dream about having high speed non-stop connectivity. I never knew that this is going to happen in my lifetime -not at least happen this quickly in a matter of 10 years- yet it holds true today. Not only that, internet and internet enabled devices are ubiquitous and surround me from every aspect of life. That tiny thing I call a mobile phone has a bandwidth 60 times more faster than the broadband connection I had back in 2006. That’s only 8 years ago.

Faster connectivity is great and highly sought after, but ability to use the countless services which are an indirect product as a result of this higher speed is what hindering my personal life, making me feel suffocated. Back in the days, the most I would use my internet was to check my email inbox, read some up-to-date news and blogs, and download a couple of freeware applications. Now all the news comes in the form of notifications as soon as an event takes place, the emails notifications keep coming as incoming calls and downloading anything that’s less than a gigabyte takes a blink of an eye. Add in all the other social networking services, facebook, twitter, google plus and countless others. The aura of mystery is gone, I know exactly what my friends and acquaintances are doing, and I can figure out correctly what they’re thinking most of the time.

Desktops, laptops, mobile devices, hell even the home appliances are now connected to the internet. The idea of your washing machine sending you a notification to your mobile device when its done washing your clothes is a fascinating one. But I ponder upon this thought, **_“Will that notification get lost in the crowd of other notifications and will my fresh underwear get locked inside my smart washing machine for eternity?”_**
